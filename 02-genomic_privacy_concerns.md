# Genomic Privacy Concerns

## Why Genomic Data Is Uniquely Sensitive

Genomic data differs from other health information—it is **inherently identifiable** (DNA is unique), **predictive & familial** (reveals predispositions for individuals and relatives), and **immutable** (cannot be changed if compromised). Even aggregated allele frequency analysis can become a privacy vector under certain conditions.


## Key Risk Amplification Factors

1. **Rare Diseases/Variants** (<1% frequency): Narrow identification pools, especially in small/isolated populations
2. **High Penetrance & Actionable Conditions**: Strong disease likelihood + required interventions = high stakes
3. **Stigmatized Conditions**: Mental health, infectious disease predispositions increase discrimination risks. e.g. HIV, hepatitis, Alzheimers, etc.
4. **Population-Specific Variants**: Ethnic/geographic markers enable group-level identification and targeting
5. **Data Context**: Small cohorts, rare disease datasets, linkable metadata amplify re-identification risks

## High-Risk Disease Categories

| **Category** | **Examples** | **Key Risks** |
|:-------------|:-------------|:---------------|
| **Hereditary Cancer** | BRCA1/2, Lynch syndrome | Rare, actionable, insurance discrimination |
| **Rare Monogenic** | Cystic fibrosis, Huntington's, SMA | Carrier inference, community stigma, lifelong impact |
| **Neurodegenerative** | Alzheimer's (APOE ε4), Parkinson's (LRRK2) | Late-onset psychological harm, population-specific variants |
| **Mental Health** | Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder | High stigma, group discrimination potential |
| **Pharmacogenomic variants** | HLA-B*57:01, CYP2C19 variants | Indirect health status revelation, treatment implications |
| **Ethnic-Specific** | Sickle cell, Tay-Sachs, β-thalassemia | Group stigmatization, targeted breaches |


## Allele Frequency Analysis: High-Stakes Examples

### APOE ε4 and Alzheimer's Disease
**Definition**: Statistical analysis comparing variant frequencies across populations to identify disease associations and population structure. Uses large-scale datasets like Simons Genome Diversity Project (SGDP) with global population samples.

**Critical Case - APOE ε4 and Alzheimer's Disease**:
- **Extreme Privacy Risk**: APOE4/4 homozygotes have ~95% penetrance for Alzheimer's by age 65 [^7^]
- **Population Differences**: African populations show ~15% ε4 frequency vs. ~25% in Europeans
- **Predictive Power**: Single genetic test can predict dementia onset within 5-year windows
- **Analysis Settings**: 
  - SGDP cohorts: >2,500 individuals, 142 populations
  - Frequency thresholds: ε4 allele 5-30% (population-dependent)
  - Statistical power: >90% detection of 0.05 frequency differences
  - Effect sizes: OR 3-15 for heterozygotes/homozygotes

**Why High Privacy Risk**:
- **Near-Deterministic**: APOE4/4 = distinct genetic form of Alzheimer's [^7^]
- **Early Detection**: Plasma biomarkers abnormal 10+ years before symptoms
- **No Prevention**: Currently no effective preventive interventions
- **Familial Impact**: 50% risk for offspring, affects family planning decisions
- **Insurance Vulnerability**: GINA excludes life/disability/long-term care coverage

**Regulatory Reality**: Current frameworks inadequate for such high-penetrance, late-onset conditions with population-specific frequencies.

### BRCA1/2 Founder Mutations and Breast Cancer

**Critical Case - BRCA1/2 Ashkenazi Jewish Founder Mutations**:
- **Extreme Privacy Risk**: Three founder mutations (185delAG, 5382insC, 6174delT) with 60-85% breast cancer penetrance, 40-50% ovarian cancer risk [^8^]
- **Population Stratification**: ~2.5% frequency in Ashkenazi Jewish population vs. <0.1% in general population
- **Predictive Power**: Single genetic test predicts cancer risk with near-deterministic outcomes for carriers
- **Analysis Settings**:
  - SGDP cohorts: Population-specific frequencies (Ashkenazi: 1 in 40 vs European: 1 in 800)
  - Frequency thresholds: 185delAG ~1% in Ashkenazi vs 0.01% in other populations
  - Statistical power: >95% detection of population-specific variants
  - Effect sizes: OR 10-20 for breast cancer, OR 40-60 for ovarian cancer

**Why High Privacy Risk**:
- **Near-Deterministic**: 60-85% lifetime cancer risk vs. 12-13% population baseline [^8^]
- **Actionable but Invasive**: Prophylactic mastectomy/oophorectomy recommendations
- **Population Targeting**: Enables ethnic-specific discrimination and breaches
- **Familial Impact**: 50% risk for offspring, affects reproductive decisions
- **Insurance Gaps**: GINA excludes life, disability, and long-term care coverage

**Regulatory Reality**: Current frameworks fail to address population-specific high-penetrance variants with ethnic stratification patterns.

Beyond preventing misuse, robust genomic privacy unlocks significant positive potential. Widespread, proactive genetic screening for preventable or manageable conditions could become a public health norm if individuals trust that their data will remain secure and under their control. The fear of data exposure currently limits participation in beneficial research and the adoption of personalized preventative strategies.

### Private database query for pharma
Drug discovery company 
- desires -> to test their set of targets (variants) on big genome datasets (which they lack of)
- constrained -> don't want to leak their set of targets

BioBank
- desires -> monetize their big genome data
- constrained -> don't want to expose any of their data

The Solution
- Drug discovery company (DDC) will query BioBank datasets, satisfying both desires and constraints of both entities.
- Flow
	- 1) DDC generates public-private key pair
	- 2) DDC encrypts its vector of targets
		- ciphertext-of-targets = encr(targets)
	- 3) DDC sends its ciphertext and public key to BioBank
	- 4) BioBank encrypts its dataset with DDC's public key
		- ciphertext-of-genomes = enc(genomes)
	- 5) BioBank performs homomorphic operations
		- f(ciphertext-of-targets, ciphertext-of-genomes) = ciphertext-of-result
	- 6) BioBank sends back the encrypted result - ciphertext-of-result
	- 7) DDC decrypts the result with its secret key
		- decr(ciphertext-of-result, secret-key) = result


## Bottom Line

Genomic innovation requires balancing discovery with discretion. Privacy isn't the enemy of progress—sophisticated privacy-enhancing technologies and robust governance enable responsible innovation that protects individuals while advancing human health.
