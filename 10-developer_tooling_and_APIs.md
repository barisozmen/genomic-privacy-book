# Chapter 10: Building with Genomic PETs: Developer Tooling and APIs

The mathematical sophistication of Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) like FHE and ZKPs (Chapters 5, 6, 6a) and the engineering efforts to make them performant (Chapter 8) are essential foundations. However, for these technologies to achieve widespread adoption in genomics, they must be accessible to bioinformaticians, software developers, and researchers who are not cryptography experts. This requires robust developer tooling, well-designed Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), and clear best practices to abstract cryptographic complexity. This chapter explores the landscape of tools and APIs that bridge the gap between cryptographic theory and practical application in genomics.

## The Abstraction Layer Imperative: From Primitives to Solutions

PETs involve complex mathematical concepts, parameter selection intricacies, and security considerations that are daunting for non-experts. Directly implementing genomic analyses using raw cryptographic primitives is error-prone and inefficient. Abstraction layers are crucial:

*   **Reducing Complexity:** Hiding the low-level details of encryption schemes, noise management, proof systems, or circuit construction.
*   **Improving Developer Productivity:** Allowing developers to focus on the genomic logic rather than cryptographic mechanics.
*   **Ensuring Security:** Providing pre-vetted, secure implementations of common operations, reducing the risk of developers introducing vulnerabilities.
*   **Promoting Interoperability:** Standardized APIs can facilitate the integration of different PET tools and libraries.

## Survey of Existing Toolkits and Libraries

A growing ecosystem of open-source libraries and commercial tools provides building blocks for PET-enabled applications.

### 1. FHE Libraries:
*(Referenced also in Chapter 6b for startup involvement)*
*   **Microsoft SEAL:** Popular C++ library supporting BFV and CKKS schemes. Known for good documentation and usability.
*   **HElib (IBM):** Supports BGV and CKKS, with a focus on efficient bootstrapping (though complex to use).
*   **OpenFHE:** A community-driven library originating from the PALISADE and HElib projects, supporting multiple FHE schemes. Aims for ease of use and performance.
*   **TFHE-rs (Zama):** Rust library implementing the TFHE scheme, known for fast programmable bootstrapping, particularly relevant for Boolean circuits and custom functions.
*   **HEAAN (CryptoLab):** Implements the CKKS scheme, widely used for privacy-preserving machine learning due to its support for approximate arithmetic.
*   **Google's FHE Transpiler:** Tools to convert C++ code into FHE-compatible computations, aiming to simplify FHE development.

**Genomic Relevance:** These libraries provide the core FHE functionalities. The challenge lies in building genomics-specific wrappers or higher-level tools on top of them.

### 2. ZKP Languages, Compilers, and Frameworks:
*   **Circom & SnarkJS:** Circom is a language for defining arithmetic circuits. SnarkJS is a JavaScript library to generate and verify Groth16 proofs. Widely used in the blockchain space.
*   **Leo:** A Rust-based statically-typed programming language developed by Aleo that compiles to ZKP circuits.
*   **Cairo (StarkWare):** A Turing-complete language for creating STARK-provable programs. Used for scaling Ethereum applications.
*   **Lurk (Protocol Labs):** A Lisp-like language for recursive ZK-SNARKs.
*   **ZoKrates:** A toolbox for zkSNARKs on Ethereum, providing a high-level language.
*   **Halo 2 (Zcash/Electric Coin Co.):** A ZKP system that doesn't require a trusted setup, with libraries available in Rust.

**Genomic Relevance:** These tools allow developers to write programs or define circuits that can then be proven in zero-knowledge. The key is to efficiently represent genomic queries or computations (e.g., "Does this encrypted genome contain variant X?" or "Was this GWAS computed correctly?") as circuits.

### 3. Startup Platforms:
As detailed in Chapter 6b, companies like Zama, Duality, and Sunscreen are developing platforms and SDKs that aim to simplify the integration of FHE and ZKPs into applications, sometimes with a focus on specific verticals like blockchain or enterprise data sharing.

## Designing PET-Native Genomic APIs

To make PETs truly useful for genomics, we need APIs tailored to common genomic tasks. These APIs would internally handle the cryptographic complexity.

### Examples of Potential Genomic PET APIs:

*   **`SecureVariantLookup(encrypted_genome, variant_of_interest) -> ZKP_of_presence_or_absence`**
    *   Allows a user to prove they have (or don't have) a specific genetic variant without revealing their full genome.
    *   Internally, this might involve FHE to query an encrypted database or ZKPs to directly prove a property of a privately held genome.
*   **`FederatedGWAS.run(encrypted_cohort_data_handles, phenotype_data) -> encrypted_gwas_results`**
    *   Takes handles to multiple encrypted genomic datasets (e.g., from different hospitals using FHE) and runs a GWAS.
    *   The API would manage the secure multi-party computation or FHE operations.
*   **`PharmacogenomicReport.generate(encrypted_genome, drug_list) -> encrypted_pgx_profile`**
    *   Computes a pharmacogenomic profile based on an encrypted genome, returning an encrypted report only the user (or authorized physician) can decrypt.
*   **`VerifyGenomicComputation(computation_inputs_commit, computation_outputs, proof_of_correctness) -> bool`**
    *   An API for a verifier to check a ZKP provided by a prover (e.g., a cloud service) that a specific genomic computation was performed correctly.
*   **`EncryptedSearch.query(encrypted_genomic_database, encrypted_query_criteria) -> encrypted_matching_records`**
    *   Allows searching over an encrypted genomic database (e.g., finding individuals with specific combinations of variants) using FHE.

### Design Principles for Genomic PET APIs:
*   **Ease of Use:** Abstract away cryptographic parameters and choices where possible.
*   **Security by Default:** Implement secure default settings.
*   **Performance Transparency (Optional):** Provide estimates or feedback on the performance implications of different API calls.
*   **Composability:** Allow different PET-enabled services to be chained together.
*   **Clear Error Handling:** Provide meaningful error messages for both cryptographic and genomic issues.
*   **Interoperability:** Adhere to emerging standards (e.g., from homomorphicencryption.org, GA4GH).

## Best Practices for Secure and Performant PET Implementation

Even with good tools and APIs, developers must follow best practices:

1.  **Understand Security Models:** Be clear about what each PET protects against (e.g., honest-but-curious server vs. malicious server) and its limitations.
2.  **Parameter Selection:**
    *   **FHE:** Choose parameters (polynomial modulus, ciphertext modulus, noise distribution) that provide the desired security level (e.g., 128-bit) for the planned computations. Use established guidelines from standards bodies or libraries.
    *   **ZKP:** Ensure the underlying cryptographic assumptions of the chosen proof system are well-understood and appropriate.
3.  **Secure Key Management (Critical for FHE):**
    *   Protect FHE secret keys rigorously. Key compromise means total data loss.
    *   Follow best practices for key generation, storage, access control, and lifecycle management (see Chapter 11).
4.  **Circuit Design for ZKPs:**
    *   Ensure the circuit accurately represents the intended computation. Bugs in circuit logic can lead to unsound proofs.
    *   Minimize non-determinism in circuits unless explicitly part of the ZKP logic.
5.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   Even in a PET context, validate inputs to prevent unexpected behavior or side-channel leakage.
6.  **Side-Channel Resistance:**
    *   Be aware of potential side channels (e.g., timing, memory access patterns) if the threat model includes an adversary observing the execution of PET operations. This is more relevant for ZKP provers or FHE on untrusted clients.
7.  **Testing and Verification:**
    *   Thoroughly test PET-enabled applications with known inputs and outputs.
    *   For ZKPs, test both honest prover and (simulated) dishonest prover scenarios.
    *   Consider formal verification for critical circuit components or cryptographic protocols if possible.
8.  **Stay Updated:**
    *   The field of PETs is rapidly evolving. Keep abreast of new research, updated library versions, and emerging security advisories.
9.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    *   Only perform computations or request proofs that are strictly necessary for the application's functionality.

## The Future: Towards Automated PET Integration

The ultimate goal for developer experience is seamless integration of PETs, potentially through:

*   **PET-Aware Compilers:** Compilers that can take high-level code (e.g., Python, C++) describing a genomic analysis and automatically generate an FHE-executable version or a ZKP circuit.
*   **Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) for Secure Genomics:** High-level languages specifically designed for writing privacy-preserving genomic analyses, with PETs handled under the hood.
*   **AI-Assisted PET Development:** AI tools that could help optimize PET parameters, design efficient ZKP circuits, or even suggest appropriate PET strategies for a given problem.

**Bottom Line:** Making genomic PETs usable by a broader range of developers is key to unlocking their potential. This requires continued development of robust libraries, user-friendly high-level tools and APIs, and clear educational resources on best practices. As these tools mature, the barrier to entry for building privacy-preserving genomic applications will lower, accelerating innovation in the field.
