- **Illumina**: [Sequencing data across customer base](https://www.illumina.com/science/technology/next-generation-sequencing.html) processing 90% of world's sequencing data

## Public Repository Benchmarks

### Major Public Datasets:
- **1000 Genomes Project**: [2,504 samples from 26 populations](https://www.internationalgenome.org/data-portal/data-collection/phase-3) - Phase 3 final release
- **UK Biobank**: [500,000+ participants](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/) with genotyping + phenotyping
- **TCGA**: [33 cancer types, 11,000+ patients](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) with multi-omic data
- **gnomAD**: [76,156 genomes, 125,748 exomes](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/) for population frequencies
- **Simons Genome Diversity Project**: [300 genomes from 142 populations](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature18964) for global diversity

## Scale Comparison: The Shocking Reality

### **Data Volume:**
- **Private Sector**: **50-100+ million genomic profiles** ([Nature Biotechnology estimate](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-019-0340-7))
- **Public Repositories**: **~2-3 million high-quality genomes** across all major databases
- **Ratio**: Private data is **25-50x larger** than public repositories

### **Storage Requirements:**
- **Per genome**: [30-100 GB storage](https://www.illumina.com/science/technology/next-generation-sequencing/beginners/ngs-data-analysis.html) (FASTQ to VCF pipeline)
- **Private sector total**: Estimated **5-10 petabytes** of genomic data
- **Cost implications**: [$1-10M annually](https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/Genomic-Data-Science) in storage costs for large biobanks

## The Siloing Problem

### **Technical Silos:**
- Incompatible data formats and standards
- Proprietary analysis pipelines
- Vendor lock-in effects
- [Format fragmentation](https://www.ga4gh.org/news/ga4gh-publishes-technical-standards-to-enable-federated-human-genomic-data-sharing/) across institutions

### **Legal Silos:**
- [HIPAA and privacy regulations](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/laws-regulations/index.html)
- [GDPR compliance requirements](https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/) for EU data
- Terms of service restrictions
- International data transfer limitations

### **Economic Silos:**
- Competitive advantage considerations
- IP protection concerns
- Revenue model dependencies
- [Clinical trial data exclusivity](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/development-approval-process-drugs/frequently-asked-questions-patents-and-exclusivity)

### **Cultural Silos:**
- Academic vs. commercial research cultures
- Publication vs. product development priorities  
- Open science vs. proprietary research models

## The $100B+ Trapped Value Problem

This data siloing creates artificial scarcity in genomics, preventing:

- **Large-scale GWAS studies** across diverse populations
- **Rare disease research acceleration** (need global cohorts)
- **Precision medicine development** at population scale
- **Population health insights** for public health policy
- **Drug discovery optimization** across demographic groups

### **Market Impact:**
- [Global genomics market: $70B+ by 2031](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/genomics-market-analysis)
- [Genetic testing market: $31B+ by 2031](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/global-genetic-testing-market-industry)
- **Estimated trapped value**: $100B+ in unrealized research and clinical applications

## The PET Solution Thesis

**Privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs)** like homomorphic encryption represent the potential solution to unlock this trapped value while preserving privacy‚Äîexplaining why **VCs are betting big on FHE startups** in the genomics space.

### **Why FHE Matters:**
- Enable computation on encrypted genomic data
- Preserve patient privacy while enabling research
- **Unlock federated analysis** across private databases
- **Regulatory compliance** with privacy laws

### **Investment Implications:**
- [Zama raised $73M Series A](https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/07/zamas-homomorphic-encryption-tech-lands-it-73m-on-a-valuatio/) at ~$400M valuation
- [Duality Technologies $30M Series B](https://www.dualitytech.com/duality-technologies-secures-30-million-in-series-b-funding/) for privacy-preserving analytics
- **Total FHE startup funding**: $200M+ in 2023-2024
